# OpenWebNet (BTicino/Legrand) Binding

This new binding integrates BTicino / Legrand MyHOME(r) BUS & ZigBee wireless (MyHOME_Play) devices using the **[OpenWebNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWebNet) protocol**.
It is the first known binding for openHAB 2 that **supports *both* wired BUS/SCS** as well as **wireless setups**, all in the same biding. The two networks can be configured simultaneously.
It's also the first OpenWebNet binding with initial support for discovery of BUS/SCS devices.
Commands from openHAB and feedback (events) from BUS/SCS and wireless network are supported.

Support for both numeric (`12345`) and alpha-numeric (`abcde` - HMAC authentication) gateway passwords is included.

## Prerequisites

In order for this biding to work, an OpenWebNet gateway is needed in your home system to talk to devices.
Currently these gateways are supported by the binding:

- **IP gateways** or scenario programmers, such as BTicino 
[F454](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/productDetail.action?productId=006), [MyHOMEServer1](http://www.bticino.com/products-catalogue/myhome_up-simple-home-automation-system/), 
[MyHOME_Screen 10](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/productDetail.action?lang=EN&productId=001), 
[MH202](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/productDetail.action?productId=059), [F455](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/productDetail.action?productId=051),
[MH200N](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/productDetail.action?productId=016), 
[F453](http://www.homesystems-legrandgroup.com/BtHomeSystems/productDetail.action?productId=027),  etc.
- **Wireless (ZigBee) USB gateways**, such as [BTicino 3578](http://www.catalogo.bticino.it/BTI-3578-EN) and [Legrand 088328](https://www.legrand.fr/pro/catalogue/35115-interface-openradio/interface-open-webnet-et-radio-pour-pilotage-dune-installation-myhome-play)

## Installation
The binding it's still *under development* and not part of the official openHAB distribution.

### Requirements
This binding requires **openHAB 2.3** or later.

### Install from Marketplace
The easiest way to install this binding is from the [Eclipse IoT Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/openwebnet-2x-binding-testing).

Make sure that the [marketplace plugin is activated](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/eclipseiotmarket.html), and then install the *OpenWebNet binding* from PaperUI (Add-ons -> Bindings -> search for 'openwebnet' then INSTALL).

Be aware that you might have to re-install the binding after an openHAB upgrade. This is a limitation of the Eclipse Marketplace plugin and will be changed in future versions of openHAB.

### Install Manually
Alternatively this binding can be installed manually:
1. Download the [latest released JAR file](https://github.com/mvalla/openhab-openwebnet/releases)

1. Copy the JAR file to your openHAB2 `addons` folder. On Linux or RaspberryPi is under: 

      `/usr/share/openhab2/addons/`

### Activate Dependencies
After the binding is installed, from Marketplace or manually, some features dependencies must be activated manually:
- from [Karaf console](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/console.html):
    - `feature:install openhab-transport-serial`
    - if you are using  **openHAB 2.4.0-xxx** also type:
 `feature:install esh-io-transport-upnp`

The binding should now be installed: check in *PaperUI > Configuration > Bindings*.

### Upgrade from previous binding release version

Since openHAB uses some cache mechanisms to load bindings, it is not enough to remove and update the binding JAR file.

It's suggested also to remove OpenWebNet Things before uninstalling the old binding, and discover/configure them again after binding has been updated.

1. From [Karaf console](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/console.html):
    - `bundle:list` to list all bundles and take note of current bundle `<ID>` for the OpenWebNet Binding
    - `bundle:uninstall <ID>` to remove previous version of the binding
1. remove the previous version of the binding JAR file from `addons/` folder
1. copy the new version of the binding JAR file to `addons/` folder
 
While upgrading, there is no need to activate dependencies again.

The new version of the binding should now be installed, check the version number in *PaperUI > Configuration > Bindings*.

## Debugging and Log Files
This binding is currently *under development*. 

To help testing it and provide feedbacks, this is the procedure to set log level to `DEBUG`: 
   - from [Karaf console](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/console.html):
     - `log:set DEBUG org.openhab.binding.openwebnet`
     - `log:set DEBUG org.openwebnet` 

Both `log:set` commands *are important* to log OWN commands exchanged between the binding and the OpenWebNet gateway.

Log files are written to either `userdata/log` (manual setup) or `/var/log/openhab2` (Linux and RaspberryPi image setup) and can be accessed using standard text reading software. 

The interesting file to provide for feedback is `openhab.log` (`events.log` is not so important).

## Discovery

Things discovery is supported using PaperUI by activating the discovery ("+") button form Inbox.

### BUS/SCS Discovery

- Gateway discovery using UPnP is *under development* and will be available only for IP gateways supporting UPnP
- For the moment the OpenWebNet IP gateway should be added manually from PaperUI or in the .things file (see [Configuring BUS/SCS Gateway](#configuring-bus-scs-gateway) below)
- IP and passoword (if needed) must be configured
- Once the gateway is added manually as a Thing, a second discovery request from Inbox will discover BUS devices
- BUS/SCS Dimmers must be ON and dimmed (30-100%) at time of discovery, otherwise they will be discovered as simple On/Off switches
    - *KNOWN ISSUE*: In some cases dimmers connected to F429 Dali-interface are not discovered with the current method. If they are not discovered automatically it's always possible to add them manually, see [Configuring Devices](#configuring-devices).

### Wireless (ZigBee) Discovery

- The USB dongle must be inserted in one of the USB ports of the openHAB computer before discovery is started
- ***IMPORTANT NOTE:*** As for the OH serial binding, on Linux the `openhab` user must be member of the `dialout` group, to be able to use USB/serial port:

    ```
    $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout openhab
    ```

    + The user will need to logout and login to see the new group added. If you added your user to this group and still cannot get permission, reboot Linux to ensure the new group permission is attached to the `openhab` user.
- Once the gateway is discovered and added, a second discovery request from Inbox will discover devices. Because of the ZigBee radio network, discovery will take ~40-60 sec. Be patient!
- Wireless devices must be part of the same ZigBee network of the USB dongle to discover them. Please refer to [this guide by BTicino](http://www.bticino.com/products-catalogue/management-of-connected-lights-and-shutters/#installation) to setup a ZigBee wirelss network which includes the USB dongle
- Only powered wireless devices part of the same ZigBee network and within radio coverage of the USB dongle will be discovered. Unreachable or not powered devices will be discovered as *GENERIC* devices and cannot be controlled. Control units cannot be discovered by the USB dongle and therefore are not supported


## Thing Configuration

### Configuring BUS/SCS Gateway

To configure the gateway using PaperUI: go to *Inbox > "+" > OpenWebNet > click `ADD MANUALLY`* and then select `OpenWebNet BUS Gateway` device, with this configuration:

- `host` : IP address / hostname of the BUS/SCS gateway (*mandatory*)
   - Example: `192.168.1.35`
- `port` : port (*optional*, default: `20000`)
- `passwd` : gateway password (*optional*)
   - Example: `abcde`
   - if the BUS/SCS gateway is configured to accept connections from the openHAB computer IP address, no password should be required

Alternatively the BUS/SCS Gateway thing can be configured using the `.things` file:

```
Bridge openwebnet:bus_gateway:mybridge [ host="192.168.1.35", passwd="abcde" ]
```

**HELP NEEDED!!!**
Start a gateway discovery, and then send your (DEBUG-level) log file to the openHAB Community OpenWebNet thread to see if UPnP discovery is supported by your BTicino IP gateway.


### Configuring Wireless (ZigBee) USB Dongle

The wirelss ZigBee USB dongle is discovered automatically and added in Inbox. Manual configuration is not supported at the moment.

### Configuring Devices

Devices can be discovered automatically from Inbox after the gateway has been configured and connected.

Devices can be also added manually from PaperUI. For each device it must be configured:

- the associated gateway (`Bridge Selection` menu)
- the `WHERE` config parameter (`OpenWebNet Device Address`):
  - example for BUS/SCS: Point to Point `A=2 PL=4` --> `WHERE="24"`
  - example for BUS/SCS: Point to Point `A=6 PL=4` on local bus --> `WHERE="64#4#01"`
  - example for BUS/SCS thermo Zones: `Zone=1` --> `WHERE="1"`; external probe `5` --> `WHERE="500"`
  - example for ZigBee/wireless: use decimal format address without the UNIT part and network: ZigBee `WHERE=414122201#9` --> `WHERE="4141222"`


## Channels

Devices support some of the following channels:

### Notes on Shutter position
For Percent commands and position feedback to work correctly, the `shutterRun` Thing config parameter must be configured equal to the time (in ms) to go from full UP to full DOWN.
It's possible to enter a value manually or set `shutterRun=AUTO` (default) to calibrate shutterRun parameter automatically the first time a Percent command is sent to the shutter: a *UP >> DOWN >> Position%* cycle will be performed automatically.
- if shutterRun is not set, or is set to AUTO but calibration has not been performed yet, then position estimation will remain `UNDEFINED`
- if shutterRun is set manually and too higher than the actual runtime, then position estimation will remain `UNDEFINED`: try to reduce shutterRun until you find the right value
- before adding/configuring roller shutter Things (or installing a binding update) it is suggested to have all roller shutters `UP`, otherwise the Percent command won’t work until the roller shutter is fully rolled up
- if the gateways gets disconnected then the binding cannot know anymore where the shutter was: if `shutterRun` is defined (and correct), then just roll the shutter all Up / Down and its position will be estimated again
- the shutter position is estimated based on UP/DOWN timing and therefore an error of ±2% is normal

## Changelog

**v2.4.0-b7** - 01/09/2018
- **[NEW, FIX #5]** **Initial support for `WHO=4` Thermoregulation** on BUS. Currently supported: zones room thermostats and external (wireless) temperature sensors. Both heating and cooling functions are supported (*TESTING NEEDED!*)
- The binding is now available on the [Eclipse IoT Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/openwebnet-2x-binding-testing)!
- **[BUG]** corrected a **bad bug** on the connection part (originally taken from the BTicino 1.x binding) that caused loosing many monitoring (feedback) messages from the gateway when several messages were received together
- **[FIX #13]** now commands sent close in a short time are sent re-using the same socket connection to the gateway. This should improve connection stability and speed in general and in particular with older BUS gateways (e.g. MH202)
- **[FIX]** improved Shutter management and position estimation, thanks to previous 2 enhancements
- minimum requirement is now openHAB 2.3, which is needed to support measurements units like °C

**v2.4.0-b6** - 02/07/2018

- updated to openHAB 2.4.0 dev branch.
- [FIX #7] added support for inverted UP/DOWN automation commands for older USB ZigBee dongles
- [BUG] some switches were wrongly discovered as dimmers (now use only commands for device discovery)
- [FIX] added support for SCS/ZIGBEE_SHUTTER_SWITCH (515/513) device types
- [FIX] added support for F455 gateways using `*99*0##` command session

**v2.3.0-b5** - 26/05/2018

- [BUG #1] state monitoring from BUS (feedback) is no longer stopped if unsupported messages are received from BUS
- [FIX] automatic reconnect to BUS when connection is lost
- [NEW] support for Gateways with string passwords (HMAC authentication), like MyHOMEServer1 
- [NEW] support for `WHO=2` Automation (shutters), both on BUS and ZigBee, with position feedback and  goto Percent. It requires setting the shutter run-time in the thing configuration. Experimental auto-calibration of the run-time is also supported!

**v2.3.0-b4** - 09/04/2018

- first public release

## Known Issues
  
Known problems:
- Setpoint Temperature can be changed only once from PaperUI, then the browser page must be refreshed (F5) to change it again. This is a [PaperUI bug](https://community.openhab.org/t/paperui-number-item-with-unit-can-be-changed-only-once/49562) for all Number items, not just in relation to this binding
- In some cases dimmers connected to a F429 Dali-interface cannot be discovered, even if switched ON and dimmed. This looks like as a limitation of some gateways that do not report Dali devices states when requested
- When a Dimmer is swiched from OFF->ON via PaperUI the old dimmer level is not restored, instead the dimmer is put to 100%
